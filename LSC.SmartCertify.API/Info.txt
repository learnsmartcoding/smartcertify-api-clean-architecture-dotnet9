Git Commands Explanation
git init

Initializes a new Git repository in your local project.
git remote add origin <URL>

Links your local repository to a remote repository (in this case, your Azure DevOps repo).
git fetch origin

Retrieves information about branches and updates from the remote repository without merging them into your local branches.
git checkout -b main

Creates a new branch named main and switches to it. This ensures your local branch matches the remote naming convention.
git add .

Stages all changes in your local project for the next commit.
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Saves the staged changes to the local repository with a descriptive message.
git push -u origin main

Pushes the local main branch to the remote repository and sets it as the default upstream branch for future pushes/pulls.
