-- Episode 12 - Work for Viewers --

As part of episode 12, we started with our CURD operations for Courses, Questions, and Choices. 
We have implemented the CURD operations for Courses and Questions and Choices. With courses, we implemented fluent validation and automapper.

Now, it's time to implement the missing check on fluent validation Questions and Choices.

1. We need to check whether the incoming model's questionid, choiceid present in the database or not. 
2. We need to check the model's questionid, choiceid present in the database or not and if not present, we should send
404 not found response.
3. Add the missing API response details as part of API documentation.
4. We need to create a new end point where the question's choice can be an array. 
Instead of inserting the choice one by one, we can insert multiple choices at once.
